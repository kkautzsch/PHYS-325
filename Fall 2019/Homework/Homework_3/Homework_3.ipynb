    "The sine function would be the most accurate because it is using multiplication and division instead of subtraction like in the cosine function. The reason subtraction gives less accuracy is because you are subtracting small values from each other but you are keeping the digits after the 16 digit in python allowing for there to be less accuracy in the measurement. Whereas in the sine function you are keeping those digits that are way out past the decimal allowing for greater accuracy when evaluating the function."
